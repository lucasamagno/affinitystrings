    <h1>Why Violin?</h1>
    <p>A violin education is one option of incorporating music education in the daily life of your child. Starting violin at an earlier age is certainly possible with the many different sizes of violins available. Children that are able to recognize the letters A, D, E and G and the numbers 1 – 4, are ready to begin violin lessons. Mrs. Marttila has taught students as young as 3 years old, including her own children. Her daughter started violin training at age 3.5 and continues to play the violin and her son began at age 5.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of Violin Lessons</h2>
    <p>As parents, we want the best for our children. We guide and nurture them throughout their most impressionable years. Studying an instrument at a very young age is unique because it is inherently multi sensory and multidisciplinary, with elements of math, language, history, and even science. Furthermore, studies have shown that musical instruction fosters growth in other academic areas and strengthens coordination.</p>
    <p>All these things aside, making music is in itself a great source of joy. It is also a great outlet for self-expression. Playing as part of a musical group creates a sense of belonging and teaches teamwork. Musical instruction helps people of all ages develop the skills for a lifetime of joyful and expressive music making! Read on to learn more about the benefits of violin training.</p>
    <h2>1 - It improves academic skills.</h2>
    <p>Music and math are highly intertwined. By understanding beat, rhythm, and scales, children are learning how to divide, create fractions, and recognize patterns. It seems that music wires a child’s brain to help him better understand other areas of math, says Lynn Kleiner, founder of Music Rhapsody in Redondo Beach, CA. As kids get older, they'll start reciting songs, calling on their short-term memory and eventually their long-term memory. Using a mnemonic device to do this is a method that can later be applied to other memory skills, says Mary Larew, Suzuki violin teacher at the Neighborhood Music School in New Haven, Connecticut. Musical instrument classes also introduce young children to basic physics. For instance, plucking the strings on a guitar or violin teaches children about harmonic and sympathetic vibrations. kids the opportunity to explore these scientific principles.</p>
    <h2>2 - It develops physical skills.</h2>
    <p>The violin demands different actions from your right and left hands simultaneously. It's like patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time. Studying the violin not only helps develop ambidexterity, but it can also encourage children to become comfortable in naturally uncomfortable positions. Enhancing coordination and perfecting timing can prepare children for other hobbies, like dance and sports.</p>
    <h2>3 - It cultivates social skills.</h2>
    <p>Group classes require peer interaction and communication, which encourage teamwork, as children must collaborate to create a crescendo or an accelerando. If a child is playing their violin too loudly or speeding up too quickly, they will need to adjust. It’s important for children to know and understand their individual part in a larger ensemble.</p>
    <h2>4 - It refines discipline and patience.</h2>
    <p>Learning the violin teaches children about delayed gratification. The violin has a steep learning curve. Before you can make a single sound, you must first learn how to hold the violin, how to hold the bow, and where to place your feet. Playing the violin teaches kids to persevere through hours, months, and sometimes years of practice before they reach specific goals, such as performing with an orchestra or memorizing a solo piece. Private lessons and practicing at home require a very focused kind of attention for even 10 minutes at a time. Group lessons also improve patience, as children must wait their turn to play individually. And in waiting for their turns and listening to their classmates play, kids learn to show their peers respect, to sit still and be quiet for designated periods of time, and to be attentive.</p>
    <h2>5 - It boosts self-esteem.</h2>
    <p>Violin lessons offer a forum where children can learn to accept and give constructive criticism. Turning negative feedback into positive change helps build self-confidence. Group lessons may help children understand that nobody is perfect and that everyone has room for improvement. Presenting yourself in public is an important skill whether you become a professional musician or not. This skill is easily transferable to public speaking. Once a child is advanced enough, they will possess musical skills that will help them stand out.</p>
    <h2>6 - It introduces children to other cultures.</h2>
    <p>By learning about and playing a variety of instruments, kids can discover how music plays a critical role in other cultures. For instance, bongos and timbales may introduce children to African and Cuban styles of music. Although the modern-day violin has roots in Italy, learning to play it exposes children to classical music popularized by German and Austrian musicians. Versatile instruments, such as the violin and piano, can accompany a wide repertoire of styles, including classical and jazz (which originated in the American South). It’s important to familiarize children with other cultures at a young age because this fosters open-mindedness about worlds and traditions beyond the ones they know.</p>
